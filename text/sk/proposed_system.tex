\chapter{Proposed system}

To be able to locate object with no previous information about it (like size)
are two views of the same object needed. This can be achieved by one moving
camera or multiple cameras. In this thesis we will take a closer look on the
second approach.

We propose a system with two cameras. Cameras are connected via USB to
computer. Two cameras provides enough information for object localization and
makes the project usable also on low-budget. The cameras placement is
important, but no precise alignment is required. Cameras should share a major
part of the view/

Our solution will be able to estimate cameras position (relatively to each
other) based on calibration process. After calibration an object is choosed
from each camera view which will be tracked. Estimated position of the cameras
and the object will be displayed. Each step of the process will be described in
the next chapters.
