\chapter{Calibration}

In process to get more accurate results we are going to firstly calibrate
cameras. This process consists of few steps to estimate camera parameters and
their relative position.

More about it in Learning OpenCV.

\section{Lens distortions}

In this chapter we will take a closer look on lens distortion. Distortion is
most effected by radial distortion and tangetial distortion. Radial dostortion
is cause by the shape of the lens. It cause distortion on the edges of the
image. In the center of the image is no distortion, but coming closer to te
edger it arrises.

Tangetial distortion is caused during assembling process of the camera. It is
almost impossible to put lens parallel to an chip.
