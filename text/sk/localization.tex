\chapter{Localization}

In previous few chapters we covered steps to obtain position of the object in
2D images. In this chapter we will take closer look of obtaining postition of
the object in 3D by combining iformation from more cameras.

At this point we have computed not only intristic matrices of the cameras but
also the rotation matrix and translation vector (from mono camera calibration
and stereo calibration). Our goal is to from tuple of coordinates from the
images taken by cameras to get a position of the object in world coodinates
(3D).

\section{Projection matrices}
We define projection matrix as tranformation matrix P, where stands: $x = P
\dot X$, where $X$ denote a vector of size 4x1 - homogenous world coordinates
of the object and $x$ denotes homogenous object coordinates in the image plane
of the camera - a vector 3x1.

\subsection{World coordinate system}
Firstly we will compute projection matrices. We define our world coordinate
system as orthogonal, with the origin in the center of the first (usually left)
camera. The positive part z-axis is poiting in front of the camera and and
below the camera is positive y-axe and to the right is positive x-axe.

\subsection{Computing projection matrices}
Projection matrix can be decomposed as $P = K[R|T]$, where K is intristic
camera matrix and $[R|T]$ is extrinstic matrix. $R$ is a rotation matrix and
$T$ translation vector. For the first camere we get this equation: $ P_1 = K_1
\dot [I_3 | 0_3]$. $K_1$ first camera instrictic parameters matrix, $I_3$
denotes identity matrix 3x3 and $0_3$ zero vector.


For the second camera results from stereo calibration will be used and since
then we get this relation: $P_2 = K_2 \dot [R | T]$, where $K_2$ is second
camera instrictic parameters matrix, $R$ rotation vector and $T$ translation
vector obtained by stereo calibration.

More about the decomposition itself could be found in article by \citet{computervisionblog}.

\section{Triangulation}
Suppose we know projection matrices for both cameras and $x_1$,$x_2$ as a
coordinates from camera images.

\section{Implementation note}
For triangulation we used OpenCV function triangulatePoints($R$, $T$, $x_1$, $x_2$).
