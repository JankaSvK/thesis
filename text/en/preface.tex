Living in the 21st century, we are witnessing a huge improvement of the
computers and their abilities. Since the beginning of the era of computers,
people have been creating machines and programs that solve problems more
efficiently than human.

From the beginning, a human has two eyes. He is equipped with stereo vision.
Moreover, human can use it from the beginning of his life, able to estimate how
far and where the object is.

Our goal is to propose a system that will be capable of similar results using a
computer and web cameras. System like that can be used to monitor and track
movement of the objects. For example, it can provide a trajectory of the
quadcopter flight, or another autonomous robot. These obtained data can be
used for additional analysis.

Therefore, we solve a problem of object detection, tracking, and stereo vision
by providing an image stream from two cameras. We focus on an overall process
from the camera calibration, through object detection in both cameras to
estimation of the object position in 3D.

At the end of the thesis, we provide results of an evaluation of the proposed
system.
