Living in the 21st century, we are witnessing a huge improvement of the
computers and their abilities. Since the beginning of the era of computers,
people were creating machines and programs that would solve problems instead of
the human. We expect from them to be able to solve any problem that human can.

From the beginning, a human has two eyes. He is equipped with stereo vision.
Moreover, it can use it from the beginning of its life, able to estimate how
far and where the object is.

Our motivation is to propose a system that will be able of similar results
using a computer and web cameras.

Therefore, we solve a problem of object detection, tracking, and stereo
vision by providing an image stream from two cameras. We focus on an overall
process from the camera calibration, through object detection in both cameras
until estimating object position in 3D.

At the end of the thesis, we provide results of evaluation of the proposed system.
