\chapter{How to run experiments}

In thesis, we mentioned many different experiments. In this chapter we provide
a description how to run them by yourself. All dependencies are required.

\section{Tracker's experiments}

All tracker's experiments are located in the directory
\verb+program/experiments/trackers+. The experiments can be started by \verb+trackers{\_}experiments.py+. First argument of the script chooses the scenario for the experiment.

\subsection*{Speed and accuracy}

\verb+trackers{\_}experiments.py 1+

This experiments runs all trackers at the each frame of the video. To compute
an inaccuracy, we use SIMPLEBACKGROUND tracker as the representative tracker
(displayed with the red bounding box).

At the end, results for all trackers are displayed. The first columns specifies
the tracker, the second represents FPS (more described in the chapter Tracker)
and the third the inaccuracy.

\verb+trackers{\_}experiments.py 2+

The second scenario consists of the same experiment, with the orange cap on the
top of the robot, to provide results also for HSV tracker.

\subsection*{Under occlusion}

\verb+trackers{\_}experiments.py 3 tracker_id+

To test a behavior of the trackers under occlusion, we provide an experiment 3.
The reslts from this experiment were obtained by human eye. If the object is
lost, the message is outputed to standard output.

Admissible \verb+tracker{\_}id+ is from \verb+0+ to \verb+8+.

\subsection*{Tracking multiple objects}

\verb+trackers{\_}experiments.py 4 tracker_id+

The fourth experiment focuses on tracking multiple objects. Again, the results were
evaluated by the human. 

Admissible \verb+tracker{\_}id+ is from \verb+0+ to \verb+8+.

\verb+trackers{\_}experiments.py 5 tracker_id+

The same experiment as previous, now with changed objects to be onecolor for
the HSV tracker.


\section{Localization experiment}
