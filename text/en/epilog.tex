This thesis proposed a system for object localization in the 3D space.

The primary goal of the thesis was to provide a step by step guide for the task
of the localization of an object in 3D. We achieved the goal by describing
a whole problem and solving it step by step in this thesis.

The thesis started with an overview of the calibration process, explaining the
essential elements of the calibration. We presented a short introduction to
calibration routines used by OpenCV, and we also described the results
obtained by this process.

We implemented detection-based trackers such as \simback{}, \hsv{} and \patt{}.
We explored available trackers in the open-source libraries. These trackers
from the OpenCV and Dlib are sequence-based. We proposed several statistics for
comparison of the trackers. We tested all trackers on several setups, measuring
their speed and accuracy. We also explored their abilities to track multiple
objects and to recover from occlusion. We presented the results in
well-organized tables and provided images for better understanding concepts.

As a next step, we explained how the projection matrices are computed. We
explained their importance in the projection of a point from 3D space to a 2D
view of each camera. The chapter also contains a description of simple
triangulation method. The method shows us how to obtain a position of the
object in 3D space if the projection matrices and the positions in the images
are available.

When all previous steps were covered, we tested the proposed system in several
environments and the settings. We studied the accuracy of the system by static
experiments and computing the estimated distances between the points and
comparing it to real values. In the end, we also provided experiments focusing
on overall experience when using the application.

The application can calibrate automatically using a chessboard pattern, track
one or more objects with a chosen tracker, display the results of the
localization live. Furthermore, it can work with the recordings instead of the
live camera views. The data from the calibration and localization are
automatically saved.

Several areas can be explored in further work. While testing the application,
we noticed a noise in some specific axis. Additional work could explore the
cause of the noise and possible methods to eliminate it. We also explored, that
the precision for the objects further away from the camera is lower compared to
the precision of the closer ones. The question remains, which parameters of our
setup influence this precision and how much. A suitable extension to this
project would be the use of more cameras and explore if this setup improves the
precision.

In the end, we consider the application usable in practice. The results are not
precise enough to provide reliable results in a precision of millimeters but
usable in many cases.
