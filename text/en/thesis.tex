I want to acknowledge and thank my supervisor for the topic and for the
patience during last two years. A great appreciation belongs to Michal Koutný
as my consultant, since he was the one who helped me with the toughest
beginning. A great appreciation belongs to my dearest, since he was with me
during the dark and bright days during writing this thesis. I thank my parents,
for never ending support. They gave me the opportunity to study. To all my
friends thank you for your understanding and ecouragement in many, many
moments of crisis. Also thank to Martin for lending me a robot for the
experiments.

% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
The purpose of this project is to propose and implement a system for object
localization using a stereo vision -- two cameras. The system computes relative
position of the cameras to each other using a calibration pattern. Then the user
selects the object to track. Different algorithms can be used for the tracking.
The tracking algorithms available are detection-based and also sequence-based.
When the object is found in the view of both cameras, it estimates a position
in three dimensional space of the object using triangulation.
