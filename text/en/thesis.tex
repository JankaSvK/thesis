This thesis is dedicated to all students who were or are struggling with the

not give up and continue.

I want to acknowledge and thank my supervisor for the topic and the patience
during last two years. A great appreciation belongs to Michal Koutný as my
consultant, since he helped me during last year a lot. A great appreciation
belongs also to my dearest Dominik Smrž since he was with me during the dark
and bright days of writing this thesis. I thank my parents for never-ending
support. They gave me the opportunity to study. To all my friends, thank you
for your understanding and encouragement in many moments of crisis. Also,
thanks to Martin Faltus for lending me a robot for the experiments.

% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
The purpose of this project is to propose and implement a system for object
localization using a stereo vision -- two cameras. The system computes the
position of the cameras relatively to each other using a calibration pattern.
Then a user selects an object to track. Different algorithms can be used for
tracking.  Both detection-based and sequence-based approaches can be used.
When the object is found in the view of both cameras, the system estimates a
position of the object in three-dimensional space using triangulation.
